# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Current Status: Fixed for Free Tier âœ…

The multiple regions deployment issue has been resolved. Your app now uses a single region (`iad1`) which is compatible with Vercel's free tier.

## Quick Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy to preview
vercel
```

## Configuration Overview

### Current Setup (Free Tier)
- **Region**: `iad1` (Washington DC, USA)
- **Target Audience**: US East Coast primary
- **Expected Performance**: 
  - US East Coast: 50-150ms
  - US West Coast: 100-200ms
  - Europe: 150-300ms
  - Asia: 300-500ms

### Why iad1 (Washington DC)?
- Optimal for US East Coast business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
- Covers 70% of US population with <200ms latency
- Best choice for SMB decision makers in your target market

## Configuration Files

### 1. Current (Free Tier): `vercel.json`
```json
{
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs20.x",
      "maxDuration": 10,
      "memory": 512
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Pro Tier Option: `vercel.pro.json`
```json
{
  "regions": ["iad1", "sfo1", "lhr1"],
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs20.x", 
      "maxDuration": 10,
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

## Upgrade to Pro Tier

### When to Upgrade ($20/month)
- >30% of traffic from outside US East Coast
- API response times >500ms become business critical
- International customer complaints about performance

### How to Upgrade
1. Upgrade your Vercel plan to Pro
2. Replace current `vercel.json` with `vercel.pro.json`:
   ```bash
   cp vercel.pro.json vercel.json
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Pro Tier Benefits
- **Global Performance**: 50-150ms response times worldwide
- **Regions**: iad1 (US East), sfo1 (US West), lhr1 (Europe)
- **Memory**: 1024MB vs 512MB for complex operations
- **Advanced Features**: Cron jobs, edge middleware

## Performance Monitoring

### Monitor These Metrics
```bash
# Check deployment regions
vercel list

# Monitor performance
vercel inspect [deployment-url]
```

### Key Performance Indicators
- API response time <500ms (US users)
- Page load time <2.5s globally
- 99.9% uptime during business hours

## Cost Analysis

| Plan | Cost/Month | Regions | Performance (Global Avg) |
|------|------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Free | $0 | 1 (iad1) | 200-400ms |
| Pro | $20 | 3 (iad1, sfo1, lhr1) | 100-200ms |

**ROI Break-even**: If >5% performance improvement = >5% conversion increase

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
vercel logs [deployment-url]

# Verify configuration
vercel inspect [deployment-url]
```

### Performance Issues
1. Check region coverage vs user geography
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
3. Consider CDN optimization before upgrading

### Common Errors
- **Multiple regions error**: Ensure `vercel.json` has single region for free tier
- **Function timeout**: Increase `maxDuration` if needed (max 10s on free tier)
- **Memory limits**: Monitor function memory usage

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Deploy with fixed configuration
2. ðŸ“Š Monitor performance for 2-4 weeks
3. ðŸ“ˆ Analyze user geography and conversion data
4. ðŸ’° Evaluate Pro tier upgrade based on business impact

**Recommendation**: Start with free tier. Your US East Coast focus makes single region deployment perfectly adequate initially.
